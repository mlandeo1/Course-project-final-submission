I feel great today and everything is wonderful
This is a neutral statement about daily activities
I hate this situation and feel terrible
Feeling happy and positive about the future
Just a regular day with nothing special
I'm so stressed and anxious about everything
Love this amazing experience
Feeling depressed and sad lately
Good mood today
Worried about upcoming events
